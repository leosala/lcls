This repository collects a series of scripts and utilities useful for fast data analysis an reduction at LCLS. In principle, these tools could be used also for other purposes (with some modifications)

The `start_python_env.sh` script can be used to set up a python environment which is not the system default one (e.g. and Anaconda installation, see http://continuum.io/downloads)

# XPP

This directory contains code specific to the LCLS XPP instrument, plus some useful examples.

# LH60

set of scripts developed during LH60 beamtime at XPP, which use the tools contained in the XPP directory
